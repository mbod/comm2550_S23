## Data analysis notebooks for COMM2550 Data Project

#### There are 4 notebooks that capture the data analysis process for the project

* `1_Ripping_Data` notebook was used to take the data from the NBA.com website as too use it for the project. I include it here to easily access data.  

* `2_Player_Ranks` notebook is the floor for my examination of the NBA ALL STAR game. I take the data given and use it to see where ALL-STARS rank amongst themselves and in the nba in points per game, assists per game, and rebounds per game. This let me learn who the outliers were both for the original selection of players pre ALL STAR game, and the outliers regarding who would've made the game if the entire season was considered. 

* `3_Specific_Player_Comparison` notebook allowed me to compare an ALL STAR (James Harden), to three All STARS who he should've made the team over. I used what I learned in the previous notebook to pick which players to compare, and then I created graphs showing how Harden out performed those players while playing a similar amount of games.

* `4_Who_would_be_AS_if_Full_Season_counted` notebook allowed me to compare players who didn't make the ALL STAR game, but are deserving of recognition by the end of the season. Again, I used the data found in the player ranks notebook to pick which players I examined, and I compare their data to strictly those who made the ALL STAR game and their stats before the ALL STAR game happened.
