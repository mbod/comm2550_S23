## COMM2550 Data Project

Welcome to my final Data_story folder!

For my project, I decided to look into the NBA All Star selections from 2023. For research purposes, I focused in on the major stats of points per game, rebounds per game, and assists per game. I chose the topic because every year NBA media loves to both give credit to players and insult players depending on their All Star status. These comments are usually disregarded because people claim that "the All Star game/selections aren't correct". This claim always interested me, and led me to delving further into the topic. Also there is a rank function you can use that would make your code simpler.

In my data story I question whether the original 2023 All Star selections were correct or not, and if the All Star selections would be the same if some players were able to be considered by their full season data (instead of just their pre All Star game data).

I hope my data story is educational as a short read, and that you find some enjoyment from learning about the topic. :)
