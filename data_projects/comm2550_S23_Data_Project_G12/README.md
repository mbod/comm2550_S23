## Intelligence & Availability for Adoption of Dog Breeds

    My project focuses on the relationship between the intelligence of different dog breeds and how many listings there are for that particular breed on Petfinder. Petfinder is a platform for people to list and adopt pets. I use a dataset from Petfinder of their data from 2019 and a dataset from a study that determines the intelligence of different dog breeds based on how many repetitions are required to teach them a new trick or command. 
    I focus primarily on the primary_breed column of the Petfinder dataset and the secondary_breed of the Petfinder dataset. These two rows indicate the breed of the dog listed on Petfinder. I add intelligence classifications in the form of new columns for each of these existing columns and make dataframes as needed in order to show the analyses of this information. 
    In the end, I reflect on the analyses that I have done and draw conclusions based on these analyses. Finally, I compare these conclusions to my original hypothesis before applying the information that I have learned to my original question.
