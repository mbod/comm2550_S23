## Data analysis notebooks for COMM2550 Data Project

My project contains 3 notebooks and 2 csv files

The 2 csv files are:
* A file from a study about the intelligence of different dog breeds based on how many repetitions are required in order to teach them a new trick.
* A file from the company Petfinder of all of their adoption listings from the year 2019.

The 3 notebooks are:
* A notebook called Dog Intelligence opening and exploring the pet intelligence data then observing a distribution of how many breeds are in each intelligence classification.
* A notebook called Petfinder Data Analysis that opens and observes the Petfinder dataframe then makes some quick observations about the most commonly listed breeds.
* A notebook called Merged data which takes the intelligence classifications and lays them over the pet listings in order to do some quantitative analysis on how many pets of each intelligence classification are listed on petfinder.

These files and notebooks will help me figure out if there is any relationship between a dog's intelligence based on breed and how often it is listed on an adoption site like Petfinder.
