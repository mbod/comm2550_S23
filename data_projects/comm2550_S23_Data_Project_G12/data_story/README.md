## Blog post of your data story for COMM2550 Data Project

    In Final Data Story, I start with outlining what I seek to accomplish through my data analysis. Then, I make predictions about what I think the results of my analysis will be. After giving some context to my project, I analyze the intersection between intelligence and primary breed listing of the different dogs that are listed for adoption. Then, I look deeper into which breeds are best represented for the primary breed listing. Next, I determine how many of the rows in my data also have a secondary breed listing before performing the same exploratory research on this column as I did for the primary breed listing. Finally, I draw conclusions about what my research has revealed and whether or not my hypothesis was affirmed.
    I approach my data story from the same perspective that I had while I was making my discoveries in my data analysis folder. I try to walk the reader through my though process with each markdown cell. My intention is to allow the reader to fall down the same well of curiosity that I did when approaching this project. I hope to lead the reader to the same conclusions that I drew from this data and analysis.
