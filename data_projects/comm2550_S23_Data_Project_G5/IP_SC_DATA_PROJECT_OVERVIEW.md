## Data project for COMM2550 _Foundations in Data Science for Communication_ (Spring 2023)


The purpose of our project was to identify and quantify any significant differences in the effectiveness of the South Korea's COVID-19 protocols with a comparison to Pennsylvania. The project began by collecting and cleaning the relevant data, including new cases, cumulative cases, new deaths, and cumulative deaths. The data was then compared on the measures taken by South Korea and Pennsylvania respectively to control the spread of the virus, such as mask mandates, social distancing guidelines, and contact tracing efforts and phases. Once the data was cleaned and organized, we organized the data and created line plots to look at the trends of cases and deaths to identify any significant differences in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 protocols between South Korea and Pennsylvania.

The project involves examining various factors that may affect the effectiveness of the COVID-19 protocols, such as population density, demographics, and healthcare resources. This would help to identify any confounding variables that may affect the comparison between South Korea and the US.
