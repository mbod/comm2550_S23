    "BREAKING: Graffiti rates in Manhattan SPIKE in March 2022. What can account for this huge rise in graffiti incidents? An article in THE CITY \"Graffiti on Subway Surges as World Visits NYC for ‘Risky Game’\" by Jose Martinez explains that following the deaths of two popular graffiti artists, Julien Blanc and Pierre Audebert, the tagging of subway cars skyrocketed. Many street artists that come from abroad want to be able to \"make their mark\" and tag a subway car in the \"birthplace of subway grafitti\" as described in the article. As restrictions on international travel were lifted in the heart of 2022 as the world began to exit the pandemic, the NYPD saw an increase in vandalised subway cars.   "

    "__As one of the world's most populous and diverse cities, New York City has a reputation for being busy, noisy, and often, chaotic. Manhattan, the most populous borough of NYC is known for its iconic skyline, bustling streets, and diverse population. With so many people living and working in close proximity, it is no surprise to 3 native New Yorkers like us that issues such as vandalism can be a concern in NYC, especially Manhattan. As a result, we took the opportunity to explore the number of graffiti complaints in Manhattan in the year 2022, using data found in the NYC Open Data Portal. Additionally, we wanted to examine crime complaints in Manhattan in 2022 and see if there was a relationship between crime and graffiti rates.__"

    "**While it is interesting to see the year's worth of graffiti complaints plotted out on a map to see which areas are most/least heavily concentrated with vandalism, we also thought it would be interesting to look into what times of the year were most/least common for graffiti incidents (see below). As explained above, there was a large spike in graffiti complaints in March of 2022 with 531 complaints filed. While we could not find much causation for this spike in our research, articles point towards higher numbers relating to a specific increase in the MTA ((source:[https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/5/5/23059299/graffiti-on-subway-surges-as-world-visits-nyc]. Perhaps this may not have to do with the graffiti specifically, but instead the quick dip in COVID-19 cases that would result in increased public transport as seen (source: [https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-totals.page].**\n",
