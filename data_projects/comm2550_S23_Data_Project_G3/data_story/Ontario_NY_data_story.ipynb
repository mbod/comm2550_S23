    "Something interesting about the graph above is it tells us that some fish species are not stocked every year. For example, Lake Herring were only stocked in 2014 and 2015. Coho were not stocked in 2014, 2017, and 2021. Lake Sturgeon were not stocked until after 2017. Rainbow Trout were not stocked in 2020 or 2021. Chinook stopped being stocked after 2019. The only species consistently stocked every year here are Lake Trout, Brown Trout and Landlocked Salmon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although information about why every single one of these changes is not readily available, we did manage to find and explanation in our qualitative research as to why Chinook stopped being stocked by New York into Lake Ontario after 2019. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) released a memo on December 20th, 2019, stating that the rationale behind this move was related to one of the lake's naturally reproducing fish species, the Alewife. Alewife are a naturally reproducing, native baitfish in Lake Ontario. Chinook feed almost exclusively on Alewife and are not native to Lake Ontario. In order to keep Alewife populations healthy, New York had to stop stocking Chinook into Lake Ontario in order to mitigate predation. Given New York stocks non-native fish into Lake Ontario, they must keep a careful eye on how these non-natives impact native fish populations and act accordingly. Stemming from this, we can assume that at least some of the other changes visible above that we could not find information on are also due to New York trying to artificially maintain a balanced ecosystem in Lake Ontario with both native and non-native fish. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may ask, why does New York stock non-native fish in the first place? Well, the answer is quite simple. Chinook and other stocked non-native fish draw hundreds of thousands of recreational fishermen to the Great Lakes every year due to these species' sportfish designations. Without the stocked non-natives, New York would be sacrificing millions in revenue every year. "

    "Our first interesting observation is that Brown Trout are stocked in the lowest quantity each year, yet the bar graph before showed us that they are stocked most frequently. Why is this? According to a publication by the NYS DEC, Brown Trout are stocked with such high frequency because of the biomass distribution the state desires. According to this paper, Brown Trout are one of Lake Ontario's most sought-after gamefish. In order to facilitate a productive nearshore fishery, New York must stock Brown Trout at a ton of different locations along the Lake's coast to ensure an evenly distributed biomass for the sportfishing industry. Basically, Brown Trout are New York's main fishing attraction, and to ensure this continues, New York must distribute Brown Trout stockings the best they can, and to do this they need to stock very frequently in many different locations (even though the overall quantity may not be that many). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another observation is that after 2014, there was a sharp drop in almost all species stocked (especially Landlocked Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and Lake Trout). Then, after 2017, these numbers seem to rise again then fall back down after 2019. It is also interesting that the quantity of each species stocked seems to fluctuate in the same general direction. When a few species are stocked at a lower quantity, it seems like the rest follow. To fully understand this we needed to look for some qualitative information. What we found was very similar to what drove the Chinook trends we saw before. According to a NYS DEC stocking strategy overview, the fluctuations in quantity of each species stocked has to do with the predator/prey balance. When New York notices that prey fish populations are in decline, they cut back on predatory fish stocking. When New York notices that there is an abundance of prey fish, they amp up the amount of predatory fish stocked. Rainbow Trout, Landlocked Salmon, and Lake Trout are all highly predatory fish. You can notice in the graph above, these species seem to witness the most dramatic fluctuations in quantity stocked. "

    "The most interesting observation we made here was that although there were fluctuations in quantities stocked as discussed in previous sections, New York had a HUGE spike in Lake Trout stockings around 2014-2015. Lake Trout are also one of the Alewife's main predators, and Lake Trout stocking fluctuations are almost always due to a predator-prey imbalance. Clearly New York really messed up and stocked way too many Lake Trout during these years, which they quickly corrected by slashing those numbers by almost 80% in 2017 from 2015. According to another piece of qualitative information we found, stocked Lake Trout genetics are different than naturally reproducing Lake Trout. The shift seen here also may have had to do with a desire to stop \"stocking over\" naturally reproducing \"wild\" Lake Trout as much as they had in previous years. Although Lake Trout are not native to Lake Ontario, fish that are stocked into the lake that naturally reproduce are called \"wild\" fish. These \"wild\" Lake Trout have genetics more prone to sustaining a naturally reproducing population. By reducing the amount of Lake Trout stocked into Lake Ontario, New York can reduce competition with the \"wild\" Lake Trout and give them a better chance of future success. These are two reasons that could explain this spike, however, the predator-prey dynamic likely carries more weight to it given how much it is talked about in official stocking strategy information. This spike in New York Lake Trout stocking can be seen as wildly irresponsible and put both native and wild fish at risk. This could certainly be an issue Canada has with US stocking practices, as the Canadian stocking methods seem much less invasive and threatening to native species."
