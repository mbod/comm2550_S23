## Data project for COMM2550 _Foundations in Data Science for Communication_ (Spring 2023)
 
- Research Question:
    * What do fish stocking practices for Lake Ontario look like in Canada compared to the US?

- Hypothesis:
    * We hypothesize that one of these two countries disproportionately stocks the waters of Lake Ontario with fish, and that fish stocking practices for Lake Ontario look different for each country.

    * contains a third notebook with combined subsets of New York and Ontario data for comparison.
  
3. `data_story` - 
    * contains a notebook of our most interesting findings from the Ontario and New York fish stocking data analysis notebooks, along with qualitative research to suggest reasons behind identified patterns.

4. `presentation` -
