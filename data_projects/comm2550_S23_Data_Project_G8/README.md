## Police Misconduct and Violence Rates: A Troubling Correlation

This project seeks to examine the relationship, if any, between abuse by the Philadelphia police force and instances of assault in the city. Using data aggregated from OpenPhilly, that records crime and complaints, visuals are created to examine the relationship. Demographic data by police district was also employed to contextualize the findings and search out possible confounding.
