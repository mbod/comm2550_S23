## Harry Potter Fanfiction and LGBTQ+ Acceptance
Ria Dawar and Michelle Pang 

For our project, we decided to analyze Harry Potter fanfiction data. Specifically, we wanted to research the potential use of fan fiction as an indicator of LGBTQ+ acceptance in society. 

We have several datasets relating to this that are stored in the /data folder, our data analysis notebook is also included, and we've included a blog post that tells our data story.
