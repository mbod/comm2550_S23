    "- Further exploration into Nigeria, a country that showed a relatively greater use of foreign aid, had a loosely negative association with lower poverty levels. For the most part, this is true at the country level that reception of aid indicates at least minor decreases in poverty. \n",
    "- Similarly, despite incidents like the Iraq War in 2005 when Iraq became the highest receiver of foreign aid in 2005, there were no records of its poverty rates. We also see a similar increase in foreign aid in Syria starting in 2011, due to the wider 2011 Arab Spring protests. Nevertheless there are no corresponding decreases in poverty recorded. There seems to be no correlation between foreign aid and poverty rates.\n",
    "- For the two wealthier subregions explored, comparison is difficult due to the lack of foreign aid recieved but Australian floods of 2010â€“11 that principally affected the three eastern states of Australia and was one of the worst in the country's history. This explains the poverty rate increase that starts from 2010."
