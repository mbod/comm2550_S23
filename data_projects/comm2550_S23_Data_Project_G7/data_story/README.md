## Blog post of your data story for COMM2550 Data Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the output of all your data analysis. 

* You should create an engaging data blog that stands alone (i.e. it doesn't require the reader to look over all your analysis notebooks). 

* Update this README file to describe the presentation.
