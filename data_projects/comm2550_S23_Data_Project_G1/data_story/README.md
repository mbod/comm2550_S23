## Blog post of your data story for COMM2550 Data Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the output of all your data analysis. 

* You should create an engaging data blog that stands alone (i.e. it doesn't require the reader to look over all your analysis notebooks). 

* Update this README file to describe the blog post.
The blog post covers our thought process while working on our project, from the motivations, to the code cells, to the analysis of our discoveries. We hope you enjoy reading our work as much as we enjoyed making it!
