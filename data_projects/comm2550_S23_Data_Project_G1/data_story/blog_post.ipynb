    "What parts of Philly have more crime? \n",
    "Does the amount of light in certain Philly districts affect the amount of crime in that district? \n",

    "**Hypothesis**: We hypothesize that the presence of light poles in a neighborhood has a negative correlation with crime rates. If we add more light poles into a neighborhood, the crime rates will go down. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible conclusions**: If the results show a negative correlation between light pole presence and crime rates, it can be concluded that increasing the number of light poles in a neighborhood may be an effective strategy for reducing crime. If there is no significant correlation between light pole presence and crime rates, it may be necessary to investigate other factors that may be contributing to crime in the area.\n",
    "*Similarly, crime rates can be correlated to other data sets, so note there could be confounding variables even if we find a correlation.*"

    "    - This way, our data illustrates where the street lights are most present with the use of the darker green shades, an example of the expressiveness principle. Because we associate darker colors with higher density, this choice of visualization matches what a viewer would most easily interpret. \n",
    "    - *In the hexplot,* we saw how the districts surrounding Center City, spanning from Chinatown area to Fishtown area, seemed to have the highest number of street lights. This fact makes sense as the downtown area in Philly is more populated and more visited, thus street poles are more necessary. \n",
    "    - *In the heatmap,* the districts with the most amount of street lights actually appear to be a bit further out than Center City. This could be due to the fact that the districts are all different sizes, so the larger districts will by nature have more street lights since there is more area to cover. "

Because our tables and heatmaps suggest that a higher amount of light correlates to slightly less crime, we could lean toward the idea that light and crime have a negative correlation.

    "**4. At this point, we wanted to dig a little deeper into our data,** as we already set the baseline steps for the coding and heatmapping. We decided to ask the question, could light affect different types of crime different amounts? \n",
    "- First, we created a filter which split the crime data into severe crimes, which we defined as ‘Aggravated Assault No Firearm’, 'Aggravated Assault Firearm', 'Rape', 'Other Sex Offenses (Not Commercialized)', 'Arson', and 'Offenses Against Family and Children'. \n",
    "- Second, we created a filter which split the crime data into petty crimes, which we defined as 'Thefts', 'Theft from Vehicle', 'Robbery No Firearm', 'Burglary Non-Residential', ‘Vandalism/Criminal Mischief', 'Disorderly Conduct', 'DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE', 'Prostitution and Commercialized Vice', 'Public Drunkenness', 'Liquor Law Violations', and 'Gambling Violations'. \n",
    "- Using these two filters, we followed the same steps we used in heatmapping all night crimes to create two new heatmaps which illustrated where severe cirmes were most present as well as where petty crimes were most present. \n",
    "- Then, we followed our same correlation table steps to define the correlations between lights and severe crime and lights and petty crime. We observed that light and severe crime had a correlation of `.36`, and then we noted that light and petty crime had a correlation of `.50`. \n",
    "- The light and severe crime correlation was relatively weaker compared to the light and petty crime correlation. We felt this made sense as petty crimes like pickpocketing might be prevented by the presence of light, due to the added difficulty which the ability to see or spot who the criminal is induces. \n",
    "- The weaker correlation between light and severe crime might be due to the fact that a street lamp would probably not prevent a murderer or other violent crime from occurring.  "

    "**5. After our presentation, we decided the next step would be to increase the granularity of our analysis,** and we decided to accomplish this goal by mapping by neighborhood. \n",

    "    - We then decided to zoom into this neighborhood to visualize how Franford's severe crime and street light data mapped out\n",

According to crime statistics from the Philadelphia Police Department, Frankford consistently ranks as one of the top neighborhoods in the city for incidents of assault and other severe crimes.\n",
    "        - The visualization was intriguing, but it did not actually reveal a large amount of correlation between street poles and severe crime. Because we have previously noted how severe crime and street lights have a weaker correlation, this could be due to the fact that we are analyzing based on severe crimes. \n",
    "- So we could also note that Upper Kensington has the highest amount of petty crimes, at a count of `97`. \n",
    "    - We decided to zoom into Upper Kensington with a similar visualization style as Franford. \n",
    "        - Upper Kensington is a neighborhood located in the Lower Northeast section of Philadelphia that has experienced some of the highest rates of petty crime in the city. Petty crimes are typically nonviolent offenses that involve theft or property damage.\n",
    "        - According to crime statistics from the Philadelphia Police Department, Upper Kensington consistently ranks as one of the top neighborhoods in the city for incidents of petty crime. These types of crimes can have a significant impact on the quality of life for residents, as they create a sense of insecurity and vulnerability. \n",
    "- Both of these neighborhoods are located along the SEPTA Market-Frankford line, which could contribute to their higher instances of crime. This could be a counfounding variable which is making us visualize correlation where there may not be any. This is just to emphasize that any correlation we note does not equal causation. "

    "This knowledge obtained from our data could contribute to city-wide solutions for preventing crime and decreasing overall crime rates. By increasing the presence of street lights, districts could be made safer. This could be due to the fact that it is easier to commit a crime if one cannot be seen, so adding lights could counteract that idea. We could also look to the idea that [citizens feel safer when walking under light as opposed to down a dark alley](https://citymonitor.ai/infrastructure/architecture-design/what-makes-people-feel-safe-night-science-street-lights-4251). In whatever reasoning, if increasing the amount of lights could help decrease crime, then it would be a good idea to install more lights, especially in crime-heavy areas. Especially if the change would be within Philly's budget, then it could serve a positive purpose."
