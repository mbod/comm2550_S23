## Data analysis notebooks for COMM2550 Data Project

### List of Notebooks:
* (1) Notebook 1
** This notebook will explore the data in the file containing information about each county's diabetes prevalence in 2017 and type of county (metropolitan or non-metropolitan) information.
** I clean it and create a simplified data frame
** **Source:** “Map of Diagnosed Diabetes Prevalence, 2017 - Rural Health Information Hub.” n.d. Www.ruralhealthinfo.org. https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/charts/37.

* (2) Notebook 2
** This notebook will explore the data in the file containing information about each state's population, mortality rate, and life expectancy by race/ethnicity, age, and gender from 1990 to 2019.
** I focus on states based on diabetes prevalence found in Notebook 1.
** **Source:** “United States Mortality Rates and Life Expectancy by State, Race, and Ethnicity 1990-2019 | GHDx.” n.d. Ghdx.healthdata.org. Accessed May 6, 2023. https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-life-expectancy-by-state-white-black-hispanic-race-ethnicity-1990-2019.

* (3) Notebook 3
** This notebook will explore the data in the file containing information about a lot of statistics for U.S. counties for many years. Given data about diabetes prevalence from Notebook 1, I will focus on 2017.
** After cleaning and adjusting the data sets into smaller data frames, I will merge them with three simplified diabetes prevalence file from Notebook 1.

* (4) Notebook 4
** In this notebook, I use the data frames created in Notebook 3 to look for any correlations between diabetes prevalence and unemployment rate, poverty rate, and income (median income and per capita income).

* (5) Notebook 5
** In this notebook, I use the data frames created in Notebook 3 to look for any correlations between diabetes prevalence and education level (high school and bachelors).

* (6) Notebook 6
** In this notebook, I use the data frames created in Notebook 3 to look for any correlations between diabetes prevalence and the percent of the population that is uninsured, connecting to data about income and poverty level.
