## My Data Project: Diabetes Prevalence and Health Disparities
### Are certain groups more at risk than others?
In this project I explored the following research question:

*What is the correlation between diabetes prevalence and social determinants of health, such as race/ethnicity, income, education level, and insurance coverage?*

To answer this question, I first looked at the diabetes prevalence data to determine which states are this question.
* What insights can we gain about diabetes prevalence among different race/ethnicity groups in these states?
* How does mortality rate and life expectancy differ for these groups?

I then sought to determine what factors related to higher diabetes prevalence rates among counties?
* How does education level, employment, insurance, and income correlate to diabetes prevalence?

My first hypothesis is that states with a higher prevalence will show a greater mortality rate, lower life expectancy for minority groups. My second hypothesis is that counties with lower income, more poverty, less education, and less insurance coverage will be correlated to higher diabetes prevalence, due to being more at risk as a result of these factors.

The 'data' folder contains all of data files I sourced form the internet and the clean and simplified data frames I created from each.

The 'data_analysis' folder contains the six notebooks I used to clean the data, make new data frames, and create graphs to visualize the data.

The 'data_story' folder contains my blog post which describes my data findings and presents my conclusions about the data and answers to my research question.

Thank you!
