## IMPORTANT NOTICE - <u>Masks are required in this class</u>
* Please make sure you are wearing a face mask fully covering both mouth and nose _before_ you enter the classroom and keep it in place _at all times_.
* Make sure you have a "properly-fitting, high-quality mask (preferably a surgical mask, KN95/KF94, N95, or [EHRS-recommended Aries mask](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/covid-19/universal-mask-and-cloth-face-covering-precautions) as opposed to a single layer cloth mask)." (UPenn Public Health Guidance).

## Course Description Goals and Objective

Acquiring and demonstrating data literacy, namely, the ability to find, appropriately handle, analyze and communicate insights from the rapidly growing spectrum of data in all aspects of modern life, is now a vital skill for virtually all workers and researchers. This course provides a foundation in the concepts, methods and applications of data science (including network science) to questions in Communication.

The course will:

* Build data literacy and help you start to develop skills working with large and complex datasets of relevance to communication behaviors in the digital world. 

* Help you become familiar with basic programming skills for data analysis using the R and Python programming languages, along with some of the common tools used for network and data analysis and visualization.

* Provide an introduction and overview of the key elements of applied data science, including the analysis of networks and machine learning (ML). 

* Consider the practical and ethical challenges of 'big data', unbiquitous data tracking and the increasing use of algorithmic (ML) decision systems.

The course serves as an introduction to and overview of courses within the Data and Network Science concentration for the Communication major. No prior programming or data analysis experience is required.

## Note about learning programming

One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop data analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of carrying out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a new spoken language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course does not require students to have any programming background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and modifying R code examples that you can find on the web etc.

## Schedule

**NOTE: This is a tentative schedule that will change as the course gets started**

#### Class structure
* Usually each class session will be divided into two parts (with a short 15 minute break between):
  1. __Content and Discussion__ - This part of the class will introduce and review the key topics onlined in the schedule. It is important that you read the assigned material __BEFORE__ the class as you'll be expected to engage in discussion and other activities based on this content.
  2. __Lab session__ - The second part will be focused on pratical exercises to put into practice what we have been learning about thinking about, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and communicating data. This will include learning some basic steps using Python and R scripts and some other tools for data analysis and visualization.
